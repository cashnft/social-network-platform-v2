# Project Updates

## 1. API Gateway Implementation
- Added NGINX as API Gateway in `/gateway` directory
- Centralized routing for all microservices
- Configured load balancing and health checks
- Added rate limiting and CORS configuration
- Routes:
  - `/api/users/*` → User Service
  - `/api/tweets/*` → Tweet Service
  - `/api/notifications/*` → Notification Service
  - `/api/search/*` → Search Service

## 2. Reliability Features
- Added Redis caching
- Implemented circuit breakers
- Added health check endpoints
- Database replication setup
- Service redundancy and automatic restarts
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Added to docker-compose.yml:
  ```yaml
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
  ```

## 3. Kubernetes Deployment
Created Kubernetes manifests in `/kubernetes` directory:
- `/deployments`: Service deployments
- `/services`: Service configurations
- `/configmaps`: Environment variables
- `/secrets`: Sensitive data
- Key features:
  - Service replication
  - Automatic scaling
  - Load balancing
  - Self-healing deployments

## 4. Security Implementation
Added security middleware in each service:
- Added `/security` folder with middleware.py
- Implemented:
  - Rate limiting (Flask-Limiter)
  - HTTPS/TLS (Flask-Talisman)
  - CSRF protection
  - Input validation
  - JWT validation
  - SQL injection prevention
  - XSS protection
- Dependencies added:
  ```txt
  Flask-Limiter==3.5.0
  Flask-Talisman==0.7.0
  ```

## How to Run
1. Start with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

2. For Kubernetes deployment:
   ```bash
   minikube start
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
   ```

## Security Configuration
- JWT authentication required for all protected routes
- Rate limiting: 200 requests per day, 50 per hour
- HTTPS enforced in production
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Regular security audits recommended
